# Design Principles

Froggr is built on several key design principles that guide its development and usage:

## 1. Plan 9 Inspiration

Froggr draws heavy inspiration from Plan 9's filesystem architecture, particularly its approach to namespace management. Like Plan 9, Froggr treats everything as a file and uses filesystem operations to manage system resources.

## 2. Per-Process Namespaces

Each Froggr session maintains its own filesystem namespace, similar to Plan 9's per-process namespaces. This isolation allows for:
- Independent namespace modifications
- Process-specific views of the filesystem
- Clean separation between different applications or services

## 3. Union Directories

Following Plan 9's union mount concept, Froggr allows multiple directories to be combined into a single view. This enables:
- Layered filesystem composition
- Dynamic content aggregation
- Flexible resource organization

## 4. Bind Operations

Bind operations are fundamental to Froggr's namespace manipulation:
- Replace: Complete replacement of target content
- Before: Prepend content to existing view
- After: Append content to existing view
- Create: Create new bindings for non-existent paths

## 5. Server-Based Architecture

Froggr implements a 9P filesystem server that:
- Handles client requests
- Manages namespace operations
- Provides filesystem access
- Maintains session state

## 6. State Management

Each session's state is:
- Persisted in /tmp/proc/<pid>
- Tracked independently
- Cleaned up automatically
- Recoverable after crashes

## 7. Clean Separation of Concerns

The system is designed with clear separation between:
- Filesystem operations
- Namespace management
- Session handling
- State persistence
- Client interactions

## 8. Explicit Over Implicit

Froggr favors explicit operations:
- Clear bind modes
- Visible namespace changes
- Traceable state modifications
- Documented side effects

## 9. Fail-Safe Operations

Operations are designed to:
- Validate inputs
- Check permissions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Clean up on failure
- Maintain consistency

## 10. Unix Integration

While inspired by Plan 9, Froggr integrates well with Unix systems:
- Works with existing filesystems
- Respects Unix permissions
- Uses familiar path conventions
- Provides Unix-like tools
