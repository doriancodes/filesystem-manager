# Frogger üê∏

Simple file system implementation using the 9P protocol

Frogger is a modern implementation of the Plan 9 filesystem protocol (9P), focusing on providing flexible namespace management through bind operations.

## What is 9P?

The 9P protocol is a network protocol developed for the Plan 9 operating system, designed to provide transparent access to resources across a network. One of its key features is the ability to manipulate the namespace through operations like `bind`.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Namespace Management**: Modify your filesystem view without affecting the underlying system
- **Multiple Binding Modes**: Support for Replace, Before, After, and Create modes
- **Union Directories**: Combine multiple directories into a single view
- **Custom Environments**: Create isolated filesystem environments
